# 2048
this is a game i made in 2 days. it shows how i code and how i debug my code.
this is by no means a finished product but it is functional.
some of the things that i know are needed/ wanted are:
- a name on the top of the frame
- a file that keeps track of the highscore
- an automatic close when there is no more moves to be made.
- an improved color scheme.
- an automatic close/ congratualtions frame when goal is achieved.
- an OS specific executable for each of the mainstream OSs
- optimization of the code.
- limiting the CPU usage.

most of which i know how to do/ can figure out how to do fairly quickly.
(fairly quickly meaning in < 2 days)
all in all, i know this is not fantastic.
i am not very experienced.
i hope this shows my dedication and commitment to improvement,
if not my capacity to learn and love of programming.
